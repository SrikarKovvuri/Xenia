**Running Our App - Setting Up React Native & Expo**
1. Install Node.js and npm

    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser. npm is a package manager for JavaScript that allows you to easily install and manage JavaScript libraries.
    You can download Node.js and npm here.
    To check if you have Node.js and npm installed, run the following commands in your terminal:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   For this, we need Node.js version 16.19.1 and npm version 9.6.7.

2. Install Expo CLI

    Expo CLI is a command line tool that allows you to easily build, run, and deploy React Native applications.
    To install Expo CLI, run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```
   To install Expo SDK, which is a collection of libraries that provide access to native device functionality, run the following command in your terminal (we'll be using version 48)
   ```
   npm install expo@48 -g
   ```
